üõ°Ô∏è PhishShield
PhishShield is a lightweight, educational phishing awareness web application that helps users‚Äîespecially small business owners‚Äîidentify common red flags in phishing emails. The platform features an interactive quiz, a real-time data dashboard showcasing common phishing keywords, and a knowledge hub with practical anti-phishing tips. This project is built using Python, Flask, SQLite, and React, and is designed to provide practical training while being backed by real-world phishing data.

This project addresses a growing need for accessible cybersecurity education tools tailored for vulnerable and under-resourced communities. Many small businesses and individuals are targeted by phishing attacks, yet lack access to proper training or the time to sift through technical documentation. PhishShield aims to bridge that gap by simulating phishing awareness training in a simple, intuitive format‚Äîequipping users with the confidence to spot red flags in suspicious messages and links.

Using real phishing email datasets sourced from public sources such as Kaggle and PhishTank, the backend Python script (phishing_analysis.py) performs keyword extraction and frequency analysis. These patterns are then stored in an SQLite database (quiz_results.db) and exposed through a Flask API. The frontend React application fetches and displays these red flags, allowing users to explore which terms and tactics are most frequently used in phishing attacks.

The phishing quiz simulates a real-world decision-making environment, presenting users with questions that require them to evaluate common phishing cues, such as urgent language, suspicious links, or spoofed sender addresses. Responses are logged in the database, and users are shown which warning signs they may have missed‚Äîencouraging continuous improvement and learning.

To reinforce learning, the platform includes a dynamic dashboard of the most common phishing keywords extracted from actual email samples. These are labeled with indicators like "Common Threat" when their frequency surpasses a threshold, allowing users to visually understand how scammers often structure their messages. An info hub further explains best practices and links to official resources like the FTC and CISA.

PhishShield was developed in alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goal #1: No Poverty, by focusing on protecting small and low-income business owners from financial loss due to cyberattacks. By raising awareness and improving cyber hygiene through an open-access tool, this app reduces digital inequality and promotes safer internet practices for vulnerable users.

From a cybersecurity perspective, the project touches on critical pillars: education, social engineering prevention, and threat intelligence. It teaches users to recognize phishing, supports secure behavior, and integrates real phishing data into practical training. The project showcases defensive techniques and user awareness‚Äîboth considered core to cybersecurity domains such as security awareness training, cyber hygiene, and social engineering prevention.

To use the project, clone the repository and install the Python and Node dependencies. Run phishing_analysis.py to populate the database with phishing keyword data. Start the Flask backend with python app.py and then launch the React frontend using npm run dev. Users can then take the quiz, see the most-missed warnings, and explore the phishing keyword dashboard. This self-contained system demonstrates how data, education, and cybersecurity can work together to serve a social good.
