‚úÖ Project Title: ‚ÄúPhishShield‚Äù ‚Äì Cybersecurity Awareness for Low-Income Entrepreneurs
UN SDG Goal: 1 ‚Äì No Poverty
Discipline: Cybersecurity
Real-World Context: Many low-income entrepreneurs and small business owners rely on digital tools (email, WhatsApp, online banking) but fall victim to phishing scams due to lack of awareness and resources. This affects their financial stability and business continuity.

Problem Statement
Small business owners in underserved communities are increasingly targeted by phishing attacks, fake invoice scams, and credential harvesting, yet most have little to no training on how to spot or prevent them. This puts their finances‚Äîand sometimes their clients'‚Äîat risk.

üß™ Project Components Breakdown
Problem Identification:

Use real phishing statistics (from FBI‚Äôs IC3 report, APWG.org, or PhishTank).

Highlight specific cases involving small businesses (e.g., fake QuickBooks invoices or DocuSign scams).

Identify Data & Research:

Collect 50‚Äì100 real phishing email samples from PhishTank or open-source datasets.

Categorize them by pattern (e.g., language, sender domain, call-to-action).

Interview or survey (if possible) small business owners in Atlanta about awareness or experiences.

Solution Development:

Build a simple web-based phishing simulation quiz (React or HTML/CSS/JS) that:

Shows real vs fake emails

Teaches users to spot red flags (spoofed URLs, urgency cues, etc.)

Include an info hub with key tips in plain English + local resource links.

Implementation Plan:

Timeline: 2‚Äì3 days research, 5‚Äì7 days build, 2‚Äì3 days testing and documentation.

Tech stack: React or basic HTML/CSS/JS, optional Firebase for hosting (or Netlify).

Roadmap: Email pattern extraction ‚Üí interface design ‚Üí quiz logic ‚Üí deployment.

Documentation & Presentation:

Show before/after quiz results (how many phishing signs the user could identify).

Highlight how this low-cost awareness tool can reduce cyber risk for small businesses.

Include metrics like time-to-complete, user feedback (if collected), and key insights.

üöÄ Why This Project Works
Real-world relevance: Phishing is a top threat; this aligns with UN SDG #1 by promoting financial protection.

Solo-buildable: Lightweight web app with modest scope, strong impact.

Showcases your skills: React/JS, cybersecurity awareness, research, and user-centered design.

How do I add some sql and python into this project?


ChatGPT said:
Great question‚Äîand adding SQL and Python will definitely make the project more well-rounded and technically impressive. Here‚Äôs how you can integrate both into your ‚ÄúPhishShield‚Äù phishing awareness project:

üîÅ Revised Project Scope with Python + SQL
1. Python Component: Email Pattern Analysis
Use Python to analyze a dataset of phishing emails to extract patterns and red flags.

What to use:

Dataset: PhishTank, Kaggle phishing datasets, or scraping examples.

Libraries: pandas, nltk or re (for text analysis), matplotlib or seaborn (optional for visualization).

Sample analysis tasks:

Count how often certain words appear in phishing vs. legit emails (e.g., ‚Äúverify,‚Äù ‚Äúurgent,‚Äù ‚Äúaccount‚Äù).

Analyze email sender domains (e.g., @paypal-secure.com vs. @paypal.com).

Visualize trends (top phishing words, most spoofed brands, etc.).

‚úÖ Result:
This data powers your quiz content and training insights. You can even save ‚Äúcommon red flag patterns‚Äù as a downloadable cheat sheet for users.

2. SQL Component: Logging & Results Storage
Use SQL to store user quiz results and phishing indicators.

Use SQLite (lightweight for solo dev) or PostgreSQL (if hosted).

Create a small database with:

users table (optional: name, email, quiz attempts)

results table (timestamp, score, most-missed red flag)

phishing_patterns table (for storing patterns extracted in Python)

Example schema:

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE TABLE results (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    email_score INTEGER,
    missed_warning TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE phishing_patterns (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    keyword TEXT,
    frequency INTEGER,
    is_common BOOLEAN
);
Connect to your frontend app with a lightweight Python Flask API (or just use Python to insert/export quiz result logs to SQL directly during dev).

üí° Integration Flow:
Python analyzes phishing data ‚Üí outputs common phrases, patterns, and visuals.

These patterns feed into your frontend quiz app.

As users take the quiz, their responses get stored in SQL, letting you show metrics like:

Most common mistakes across all users

Quiz improvement over time

"What you missed" breakdown after each session

üìÖ Suggested 2-Week Plan:
Days 1‚Äì3: Research phishing trends + gather dataset

Days 4‚Äì6: Python analysis + generate insights

Days 7‚Äì10: Build quiz app and connect Python output

Days 11‚Äì12: Integrate SQLite to log results

Days 13‚Äì14: Final polish, writeup, and presentation prep

Perfect! Here's a quick starter kit that includes:

‚úÖ Python script structure for analyzing phishing patterns

‚úÖ Sample SQLite schema + queries to store and retrieve quiz results

üêç Python Script: phishing_analysis.py
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import re
from collections import Counter

# Load your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('phishing_emails.csv')  # Replace with your dataset path
phishing_texts = df['email_text']  # Adjust column name as needed

# Extract keywords from emails (very basic example)
def extract_keywords(text):
    words = re.findall(r'\b\w{4,}\b', text.lower())  # Words with 4+ letters
    return words

# Apply function to all emails
all_words = []
for email in phishing_texts.dropna():
    all_words.extend(extract_keywords(email))

# Count most common words
common_words = Counter(all_words).most_common(20)
print("Top phishing words:")
for word, freq in common_words:
    print(f"{word}: {freq}")

# Optionally save to CSV or DB
keywords_df = pd.DataFrame(common_words, columns=["keyword", "frequency"])
keywords_df['is_common'] = keywords_df['frequency'] > 10
keywords_df.to_csv("top_phishing_words.csv", index=False)
You could use this CSV in your web app to dynamically build quiz questions like:
‚ÄúWhich of these phrases is a red flag in phishing emails?‚Äù

üß± SQLite Setup: quiz_results.db
Use this schema to store quiz results and keyword data:
sql
Copy
Edit
-- results table
CREATE TABLE results (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_email TEXT,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    score INTEGER,
    missed_warning TEXT
);

-- phishing keywords table
CREATE TABLE phishing_patterns (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    keyword TEXT NOT NULL,
    frequency INTEGER,
    is_common BOOLEAN
);
Sample Python snippet to insert quiz result:
python
Copy
Edit
import sqlite3

conn = sqlite3.connect('quiz_results.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Insert quiz result
cursor.execute("""
    INSERT INTO results (user_email, score, missed_warning)
    VALUES (?, ?, ?)
""", ('test@example.com', 6, 'Clicked suspicious link'))

conn.commit()
conn.close()
Query most-missed phishing cues:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT missed_warning, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM results
GROUP BY missed_warning
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 5;
üîÅ How This All Ties Together
Use Python to mine phishing data and extract real-world threats

Store that data in SQLite

Quiz users in your frontend based on those red flags

Log quiz outcomes to SQL ‚Üí analyze which phishing cues people are most vulnerable to

Would you like help scaffolding the frontend portion (React or vanilla HTML/JS) or setting up the Flask API to connect everything?# GooglexMentorMexCeybersecurityCapstoneProject
